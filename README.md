# MatrixPath
An implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm, which finds the fastest (least expensive) route from the upper left corner of the matrix to the lower right corner.

The matrix is given in the in.txt file and the programs outputs the total minimum distance in the out.txt file.
The first line in in.txt indicates the size of the matrix, e.g. 500 means that the matrix is of size 500x500.
